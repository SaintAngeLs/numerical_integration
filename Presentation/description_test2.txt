This test function for 'doubletrap' function -- functional module responsible for composite trapezoidal rule application with respect to each variable, performs numerical integration of f(x, y) = y^2 over a square region.
It calculates the actual value of the integral for different numbers of subintervals (n and m), compares it with the expected analytical value, and computes both the absolute and theoretical errors,along with the time taken for each computation.

For the function y^2, the theoretical error of the trapezoidal rule can be estimated using its known second derivatives, which are constants (fxx = 0, fyy = 2). The theoretical error, based on the second derivatives, reflects the upper bound of the actual error, and should typically be larger than the actual error observed in practice. The theoretical error for the trapezoidal rule is proportional to the square 
of the step size h (hence h^2),  where h is the length of the subinterval on the integration grid. The error is given by: ((d-c)^3 / (12*m^2)) * fyy for y^2, since fxx equals zero and does not contribute.For certain functions, like polynomials of degree two or less, the trapezoidal rule can integrate the function exactly over each subinterval due to its linear interpolation basis. Thus, for the function f(x, y) = y^2, the theoretical error estimate coincides with the absolute error because the second derivative of the function is constant, and the error estimate is a direct reflection of this constant curvature. As a result, the worst-case scenario assumed for the theoretical error estimate actually manifests throughout the integration domain, leading to the theoretical error precisely matching the absolute error.
