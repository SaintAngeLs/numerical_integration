Testing function is designed to provide the numerical test the performance of the 'P1Z18_AVO_combined' -- main functional module responsible for the task solution, by comparison the evaluated results value for both transfomrations with the analitical value of the double integral calculated using the polar coordinates. 
Functions used in test are f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2, f(x, y) = x*y, f(x, y) = exp(-x^2-y^2), f(x, y) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2), f(x, y) = x^4*y^2, f(x, y) = exp(x.^2 + y.^2), for which the values of the double integrals calculated with the domain transfomation are  pi/2, 0, pi*(1-exp(-1)), 2*pi/3, pi/64, pi*(exp(1) - 1) respectfully. Transformations from square to disc are:
#1 := ( x = 0.5 * (u + 1) * cos(pi * (v + 1)); y = 0.5 * (u + 1) * sin(pi * (v + 1)) );
#2 := ( x = u * sqrt(1 - v^2 / (2 * r^2)), y = v * sqrt(1 - u^2 / (2 * r^2)) );
{{Approx. Value_1}, {Approx. Value_2}} are the values obtained after application the composite trapezoidal rule with transformation to square for the transformation #1 and #2 respectfully. {{Absolute Error_1},  {Absolute Error_2}} are the absolute errors according to the exact value (Exact Value) of the doble integral for the specific function for the transformation #1 and #2 respectfully.
