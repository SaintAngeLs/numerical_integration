This test function for 'transform_circle_to_square_1' function -- functional module part of the 'transformed_function' responsible for performing transfomration of the domain from the circle  to square using the transfomration x(u, v) = 0.5 * (u + 1) .* cos(pi * (v + 1)); y(u, v)  = 0.5 * (u + 1) .* sin(pi * (v + 1));.
This function demonstrates two transformations that convert a set of points from a square distribution to a circle distribution. A total of num_points =: 100000  random points are generated within a unit square [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]  using the coordiantes (u, v), where  u = 2 * (rand(num_points, 1) - 0.5) (random x-coordinate in [-1,1)) v = 2 * (rand(num_points, 1) - 0.5); (random y-coordinate in [-1,1)). These points are then converted into Cartesian coordinates (x, y) before being transformed into a square distribution. The resulting distributions are plotted side by side for comparison.
