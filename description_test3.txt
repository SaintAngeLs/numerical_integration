This function demonstrates two transformations that convert a set of points from a circular distribution to a square distribution.  A total of 100000  random points are generated within a unit circle  using polar coordinates (r, theta) where r is the radius and theta is the angle 'These points are then converted into Cartesian coordinates (u, v) before being transformed by two different methods into a square distribution. The resulting distributions are plotted side by side for comparison.
